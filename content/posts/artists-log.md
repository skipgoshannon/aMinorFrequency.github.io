I’ve decided to start work on a new art project, which will culminate in an exhibit/installation a little over a year from now. It’s quite a large undertaking. It requires me to learn to build computers and other technology, and also learn to code in javascript and Processing. I’m currently writing this on the raspberry pi computer that I put together for this project, and I’ll be doing any coding or other work pertaining to the project only on this computer.

The project will consist of several parts: building the tools; creating generative art and music using code and other methods (like randomization and chance); creating animations; handmaking art by screenprinting, block printing, and painting/drawing. Then, I'll use a pen plotter to draw my generated art on top of those things. I'll also be building small electronic devices to display the resulting art and creating some interactive pieces for the show using code, which will be displayed on a vintage apple iie computer. I have some thoughts about creating a device with a camera that will photograph the viewer of the art, then print out these images using a small thermal printer and add the art to the wall day by day throughout the month that the show is on exhibit. I might screenprint some of the generated art as well.

I’ll be keeping this blog as a way to document my progress through the project. I’ll also talk more about why I’m doing it and what I’m learning along the way. I don’t know yet if I’ll publish this for the show, or if I’ll just post it online as I go and leave a link to the finished blog at my show. I’m still in the early stages of understanding what it is I want to do and how to do all of it. This weekend, I’ve purchased some of the items needed to get started, including the raspberry pi computer that I’m writing this on, along with several books on Javascript, Processing, and p5.js. I have a lot to learn about how to use these languages to create art, but I’m excited about the idea of doing so!

The next part of the project will be to create the blog on github. Tomorrow, I’ll be receiving the parts to start converting this raspberry pi into a cyberdeck, which will be my primary tool in the creation of this project.

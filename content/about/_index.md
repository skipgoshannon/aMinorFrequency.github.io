This website exists as a log for an art project by me, Shannon Palmer, titled "a minor Frequency."

This project will span 15 months, culminating in an installation at a local gallery. The purpose of keeping this log is to make sure I stay on track, while giving me a space to discuss my headspace as I learn and work, share progress, and so on.

You might find images, videos, code snippets, tiny apps, or musical compositions created with code, hardware synths, or Ableton Live. All of these bits will eventually become part of the body of work. Please check the "posts" tab in the menu above to get more up-to-date or in-depth information about this whole thing.

(In addition to the above, this is a way to chat with family and friends after embarking on a long hiatus from much of social media, which was done for the sake of clarity and positive mental health. So, if you are a friend, please do read and feel free to connect with me!)
